  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">We were hopeful that we could get GPT-3—an AI program that is capable of producing writing that’s  indistinguishable from humans—to create a winning caption for the venerated <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/contest?id=230&source=search_google_dsa_paid&gclid=Cj0KCQiAoNWOBhCwARIsAAiHnEjEgezPeBVMmDNNlfUfJA8WW1s2GhbyJFoQ9TthDbRUum3sO2M4oGMaAsVKEALw_wcB t" target="_blank">New Yorker Cartoon
    Caption Contest</a>.
  </p></section>
<section class="svelte-1nn0bst"><p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><span class="bolded svelte-1nn0bst">We were impressed by what an AI could generate. </span>Here’s one of our favorite captions authored by AI program GPT-3.
  </p>

  <div class="wide-mode white svelte-1nn0bst"><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/61327f4b4bc5f041092d873b/master/w_580,c_limit/210913_a25275_771.jpg" alt="captionless cartoon by Drew Dernavich" class="svelte-1nn0bst">
    <p class="caption svelte-1nn0bst">“Don&#39;t worry, dear. It&#39;s just the magnetism of my personality.”</p></div>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">What a masterpiece! Even I would be skeptical that a computer could pull off a double entendre,
    and we didn’t even need any special skills to generate it. Here was the process:
  </p>
  <div class="wide-mode white svelte-1nn0bst"><video muted alt="Video of GPT-3 generating a caption for the cartoon of a 'A couple are sitting on a couch and surrounded by five guys who have metal detectors who are sweeping the floor around the couch, looking for metal. What is the woman saying to the man?'" src="assets/videos/playground.mp4" controls autoplay loop></video></div>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">GPT-3 is an open-to-the-public tool (just create an account <a href="https://beta.openai.com/playground" target="_blank">here</a>). The “playground” mode is just a text box. Enter some text and GPT-3 generates a response, wielding a language model that’s trained on THE ENTIRE INTERNET (if you’re curious about how predictive language models work, check out our interactive explanation <a href="https://pudding.cool/2019/04/text-prediction" target="_blank">here</a>). In this case we entered,
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><i>“A couple are sitting on a couch and surrounded by five guys who have metal detectors who are
      sweeping the floor around the couch, looking for metal. What is the woman saying to the man?”</i></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">GPT-3 then generates the following caption:</p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><i>“Don&#39;t worry, dear. It&#39;s just the magnetism of my personality.”</i></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">We could also track how our captions ranked among the New Yorker’s thousands of entries for each
    week’s contest. It runs a <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mlnow-newyorker/captioncontest_s3.html" target="_blank">survey</a>
    that prompts people with a caption and asks whether it is funny. The magazine
    <a href="https://nextml.github.io/caption-contest-data2/" target="_blank">publishes</a> the results
    and its editors then choose the finalists from the ranked list.

  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">In 2015, former New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08126.pdf" target="_blank">released a study</a>
    with data scientists at Microsoft about how to detect “funniness” in reader-submitted cartoon captions.
    They concluded that captions related to a cartoon’s anomaly (i.e., what was odd/unique in it) mattered
    a lot in terms of its funniness ranking by readers. We called this experiment
    <a href="contest/761">Anomaly + AI = Comedy?</a></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">We asked readers to describe the image and why it was funny. From there, we fed those
    descriptions into GPT-3 as the cartoon’s description.

    this experiment, modeling a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVM7zaqw7ZU">YouTube series</a> where comedians narrate
    their thought process while coming up with caption ideas for the New Yorker cartoon caption contest.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">James fed a generic version of this script into the GPT-3 text prompt for various comedians.
    GPT-3 is clever enough to generate text in the style of a comedian, and he tested this process
    with Seinfeld, John Swartzwelder, Dave Chapelle, &quot;a Simpsons Writer,&quot; Larry Wood, and Demetri
    Martin.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Results were slightly better for Demetri Martin in James’ own blind voting (which makes
    sense—his comedy relies on deadpan one-liners), so we called this experiment <a href="contest/762">The Demetri Martin</a>.

      <span class="svelte-1nn0bst">Today, we are excited to invite COMEDIAN to the stage. INSERT FACTS ABOUT COMEDIAN.<br>
        Interviewer: What would you say is the secret to a good New Yorker caption?<br>
        COMEDIAN: 1. Be brief. Although some great captions are long brevity really is the soul of wit.
        2. End with the punch line, a closing word or phrase that surprises the reader and gives the
        cartoon meaning. In many unsuccessful captions, the word that should appear at the very end gets
        buried in the middle. 3. Work hard to ensure that your caption makes sense of the cartoon, either
        by reconciling two disparate elements or by providing a backstory, and by making sure that you
        know which character in the cartoon is speaking and delivering the line.<br>
        Interviewer: I have a few New Yorker cartoons here that need a caption. I was wondering if you
        could come up with some funny captions.<br>
        COMEDIAN: I&#39;d be happy to try!<br>
        Interviewer: Here is the cartoon.<br>
        COMEDIAN: Okay, so in this cartoon, it looks like we&#39;re in a fire station. There are two firemen
        looking at the poles they slide down to get to the first floor. But each hole that the poles
        go down into is different: one is square and one is a circle. One of the firemen seems to be
        saying something to the other one.<br>
        COMEDIAN: How about this: &quot;Since when did the pizza delivery guy get his own pole?&quot;<br>
        Interviewer: That&#39;s funny! Insinuating that the pizza delivery guy gets the square hole because
        it&#39;s a pizza box shape. How about another one?<br>
        COMEDIAN: Sure: &quot;Is the fire in Times Square or Columbus Circle?&quot;<br>
        Interviewer: That&#39;s funny! Insinuating that there is a requirement to go down a particular hole
        given a location.<br>
        Interviewer: Let&#39;s move on to a new cartoon. Here it is.<br>
        COMEDIAN: Okay, in this cartoon, there are three mice running in hamster wheels. A fourth hamster
        wheel is empty. In front of it, a turtle is talking to a mouse who is holding a clipboard in
        front of the empty hamster wheel. Interesting that he is the only turtle there. It seems like
        the mouse is explaining something to the turtle.<br>
        COMEDIAN: How about this: &quot;

  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Next we decided that maybe the model just needs to know what a winning caption sounds like. We
    gave GPT-3 a number of finalists from past contests, hoping it would use a similar type of

  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">GPT-3 advisor <a href="https://pudding.cool/author/pamela-mishkin" target="_blank">Pamela Mishkin</a>
    hypothesized that using a chatbot approach might yield better results. She had used this approach
    in her essay
    <a href="https://pudding.cool/2021/03/love-and-ai/" target="_blank">Nothing Breaks Like A.I. Heart</a> and produced compelling responses. The thought was that GPT-3 wouldn’t have to answer a specific
    question such as, “generate a caption for a cartoon with X.” Instead, we could ask GPT-3 what it
    thought was funny about the scene, or what were some common themes that could be the foundation for
    a good joke.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">We first described the cartoon to GPT-3 and allowed the bot to ask questions about the cartoon.
    Funnily enough, it asked things like, “Do you think the dragon is winning? Is the princess
    crying? Is the knight bringing ice cream?”
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Our responses to these questions would obviously shape the dialogue, and we had a lot of fun
    with the back-and-forth. We responded to GPT-3 with, “I think the princess is winning. She is
    confident. The knight is trying to save the princess”
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">The results were worse than our previous experiments, but the dialogues were entertaining
    nonetheless. Here’s an example where things got existential:
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Human: What would be a funny caption for a cartoon about ping pong and dragons?<br>AI: &quot;Ping
    Pang: The tales they tell about a princess and her pet dragon playing ping pong.<br>Human:
    That&#39;s a good pun I guess.<br>AI: I&#39;m happy to make you happy.<br>Human: My story is about
    dragons play ping pong? Can you think of a funny way to say what happens next?<br>AI: How
    about &quot;This is the best day of my life&quot;<br>Human: you&#39;re not very funny.<br>AI: None of my
    jokes are very funny

  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Our plan was that Bob Mankoff could take a GPT-3 generated caption, such as “He eats the books,”
    and tweak it to, “You know, it’d be funnier if it was, ‘he eats this stuff up.’”
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Mankoff also elicited a few topics that we leaned on GPT-3 to augment. He started out with the
    idea that alligators could be a new type of bookstore pet, so we asked GPT-3, “What are some
    other pets found in bookstores?”
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">This experiment, called <a href="contest/769">The Expert</a>, was the first attempt where the
    caption candidates were not directly generated by GPT-3. We figured that GPT-3 assisting with
    captions, rather than generating them from scratch, would be a better approach to winning the
    contest.

    expert caption-writer in the room. This experiment, named, <a href="contest/771">The Writers Room</a>, involved a lot of back-and-forth with GPT-3, with both Mankoff and Wood riffing on different
    ideas.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Generally we were really impressed with the results: GPT-3 generated underwhelming captions
    which would then be polished into outstanding captions by Wood and Mankoff.

<section class="svelte-1nn0bst"><p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><b>How to win the New Yorker Caption Contest</b></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><i>Phrasing Matters</i></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Everyone lands on the same joke angles. Here is contest #771:</p>
  <div class="wide-mode white svelte-1nn0bst"><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/61327f4b4bc5f041092d873b/master/w_580,c_limit/210913_a25275_771.jpg" alt="captionless cartoon by Drew Dernavich" class="svelte-1nn0bst"></div>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">The most-common jokes were about:</p>
  <ul class="svelte-1nn0bst"><li class="svelte-1nn0bst">Finding a ring - 760 entries contained “ring,” 4th, 5th, and 7th most-funny were about “not
      buying a ring.”
    </li>
    <li class="svelte-1nn0bst">Losing keys (310 entries), remote (264 entries) and phone (103 entries)</li>
    <li class="svelte-1nn0bst">References to (and double entendres) of change (287 entries)</li></ul>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">We landed on these angles (and nearly all themes among the <a href="https://nextml.github.io/caption-contest-data2/dashboards/771.html" target="_blank">contest’s entries</a>) pretty quickly in our brainstorm with GPT-3. Since so many people submitted a caption related
    to “rings,” the highest ranking were the best versions with the most pithy,
    oh-so-smoothly-rolls-off-the-tongue phrasing.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Very rarely did the finalists use a unique joke angle, which means GPT-3 might be well-suited
    when it comes to generating the pool of joke angles. But to consistently rank in the top 100,
    you likely need a human to perfect the writing.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">Mankoff, for example, took GPT-3’s output of “Don&#39;t worry, dear. It&#39;s just the magnetism of my
    personality&quot; and perfected it to “I told you I had a magnetic personality.” We didn’t submit
    this caption, but 50 other people entered a “magnetic” joke, with “I asked them to try to find
    your magnetic personality.” ranking at #153.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><i>Puns and Double Entendres</i></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">We never experimented with different figures of speech, but we were hopeful that this would be
    where a computer would be useful. In theory, we could take the themes of a cartoon and search
    pun databases for possible candidates. Very few people submit these types of captions, making
    them more unique and unlikely to rely on pithy writing. For example, “No, I said you&#39;ve lost
    your mettle” ranked at #51 in the above cartoon, a pun that could have been generated by GPT-3.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><i>Better Models</i></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">GPT-3 was an easy way to test our theory that a computer could reliably produce humor. It relies
    on a general natural language model, and we tried to point it in the direction of the sort of
    intellectual, subtle humor that’s found in the New Yorker. But that wasn’t easy: GPT-3 would
    tend to produce “dad jokes” if simply asked to write a funny caption for a cartoon.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">If we were to create a model from scratch, we’d lean on <a href="http://erichorvitz.com/phumor.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>, which describes the different aspects of high-ranking captions, specifically focusing on the
    cartoon’s anomaly and caption pithiness.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst"><b>The Caption Contest as a humor barometer</b></p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">We started this project with the premise of wielding GPT-3 for comedy, but Pamela Mishkin, who
    was the project’s computational humor expert, aptly questioned this premise.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">She pointed out that, in her opinion, New Yorker cartoon captions aren’t actually funny, a sentiment echoed by
    many people, and based on the way readers ranked captions, it increasingly became clear that
    this contest was actually a competition in cleverness instead of laugh-out-loud humor. Indeed,
    very rarely would a caption finalist make us laugh. The barometer for a good caption was <i>at most</i> a chuckle, which is a pretty damn low bar for humor.
  </p>
  <p class="svelte-1nn0bst">In short, an AI that can produce winning captions does mean we have accomplished anything in the
    realm of computational humor. Rather, we’ve figured out whether an AI can write New Yorker-style
    captions, which is an impressive feat, but not one that means we can leave joke writing to
    computers.
